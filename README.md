## How it works

This game is built on top of [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html). I obviously can't explain how it
works here, so you'll have to jump yourself in the source code. Start with the entry point, `run.py`.

Beside the game itself, I use [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) to generate the executables. It packs up all the
game and its assets in a single executable file so players just have to run it with nothing to install. This task is
performed by the `build_*` scripts to be ran in the corresponding OS.

Network gaming is done by [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) using [Autobahn](http://autobahn.ws/python/).
A [master server](https://github.com/EpocDotFr/connectfour-master-server) (with the help of a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
API) is used to centralize all Connect Four games.

## Gotcha

This is my very first game I ever crafted, and my very first projet using PyGame, so please be indulgent.
